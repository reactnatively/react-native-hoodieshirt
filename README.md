# React Natively

Projects that use React Native to tell the story of humanity. Here we'll capture how humans interact with each other using technology.

## HoodieShirt
Here we'll learn how to sell clothing using React Native, PHP &amp; Stripe. We're creating a simple app to allow the basics of an ecommerce store to come to life. iOS &amp; Android users will have the ability to log in, add items to a persistent cart, and make purchases with saved cards.

_PLEASE NOTE: It is critical that this app be developed with React Native because we want to deploy to our intern group for testing on either iOS or Android devices._

## Other requirements and key considerations

This is 1 of several other React Natively mini projects that are meant to be stand alone apps that run on both iOS and Android. They may also be submitted to their respective mobile app stores - in some form - in the near future.

- iOS (Device preference: iPhone 6 and above)
- Android (OS: Latest OS or next the latest)
- React Native (v0.57)
- Keep folder structure
- Expo
- Use logical naming for state
- Use AsyncStorage for storage

What's expected is a complete independent code bundles that successfully build Android and iOS binaries. All dependencies must be clearly identified.

Thanks!
